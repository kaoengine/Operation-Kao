# As A FE leader
> A user is a person who utilizes a computer or network service. Users of computer systems and software products generally lack the technical expertise required to fully understand how they work. Power users use advanced features of programs, though they are not necessarily capable of computer programming and system administration

- After get the draft design from UI teams:
## User perspective
- As a user what do you want to improve the UI
## Super User perspective 
> In computing, the superuser is a special user account used for system administration. Depending on the operating system, the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier of zero is the superuser, regardless of the name of that account; and in systems which implement a role based security model, any user with the role of superuser can carry out all actions of the superuser account. The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.

- As a super-user what do you want to improve the UI
- Contribute to non-functional and functional features.
- From experiences working with Mobile or Web what do you think how to improve the design.
## Technical Architect perspective
- Designing's process is following up the market trend : Realtime-collaboration, feature management, component system.
- Aware about the market value of components, make discussion and finalize strategy about component road-map with PO, DESIGN TEAM. What is really important when we put these task to development phase? 
- [ ] Designer team and tech team must be on the same set of tools as Figma, XD.
- Component complexity and risk. Example: Data grid view when we build it in house, there are many risk about performances. When data be bigger.
- When Risk(resources, timeline, quality) is to much with technical side, then must to discuss with design team about alternative solution.
